# Technical Analysis

Create a new heading at the end of the document. 

> [!tip] Headings in Markdown start with a `#` symbol. One `#` is equivalent to Heading 1, `##` is Heading 2, etc.

In this section, document the process of configuring the server. Explain the process (starting with 'nothing') of:

- hardware requirements,
