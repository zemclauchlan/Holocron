## Virtualisation
Virtualisation is a technology that allows multiple operating systems and applications to run simultaneously on a single physical server or computer. This is achieved by creating virtual machines (VMs), which are isolated containers that emulate the hardware of a physical computer. Each VM has its own dedicated resources and operates independently of other VMs running on the same physical machine.

**Benefits of Virtualisation**

- Resource optimisation
- Isolation and security
- Flexibility and scalability
- Workload consolidation
- Disaster recovery

**VirtualBox**

VirtualBox is a Type 2 hypervisor that allows users to create and run multiple VMs on a single host computer. It is free, easy to use, and supports a wide range of guest operating systems.

**Benefits of Using VirtualBox**

- Free and open source
- Easy to use
- Wide compatibility
- Snapshot and restore
- Shared folders

**Example Use Cases**

Virtualization and VirtualBox can be used for a variety of purposes, including:

- Development and testing
- Education
- Home lab
- Disaster recovery

**Conclusion**

Virtualisation is a powerful technology that can provide significant benefits for IT environments. VirtualBox is a popular and versatile virtualisation platform that makes it easy to create and manage VMs. By combining virtualisation and VirtualBox, users can consolidate workloads, improve security, and increase flexibility and scalability.
