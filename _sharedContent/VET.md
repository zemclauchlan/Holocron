# What is VET?

**VET = Vocational Education and Training** - This lets you learn job skills in school!

- **Practical classes:** These combine the latest knowledge with what you need to get a job or keep learning later (like college).
- **Be work ready:** You'll gain hands-on experience, see what workplaces are really like, and develop skills employers love, like teamwork and communication.

**The Government backs VET:** It helps Australia get the skilled workers it needs, like training a strong team! 🇦🇺

- **Lots of choices:** VET courses come in all areas, from childcare to computers and even construction! ️
- **Nationally recognized:** Your VET qualification is like a respected badge that anyone in Australia understands.

**South Canberra Schools VET:** We offer these courses, and you can earn certificates that prove your skills!

- **Finish the work:** To get the full certificate, you gotta complete all the "competencies" (think like mini-tasks).
- **Partway through? No problem!** You'll still get a statement saying what you achieved.
