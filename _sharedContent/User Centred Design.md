A lot of IT projects are designed with the end-user in mind (which was not always the case!)

User-centered design (UCD) is an approach to designing products, systems, and services that prioritises the needs and preferences of the end-users. It involves understanding the users' goals, tasks, and contexts, and using that understanding to inform every stage of the design process.

UCD starts with gathering information about the users through methods such as interviews, surveys, and observations. This helps to identify their characteristics, motivations, and challenges. This information forms the foundation for creating user personas, which are fictional representations of different user types that capture their goals, preferences, and behaviours.

Once the user personas are established, the design team uses them as a reference point throughout the design process. They consider how each design decision will impact the user experience, and aim to create solutions that are intuitive, efficient, and enjoyable to use.

Prototyping and iterative testing are key components of UCD. Designers create low-fidelity prototypes early in the process to gather feedback from users and make necessary refinements. This iterative testing allows designers to identify and address any usability issues or misunderstandings before the final product is developed.

The ultimate goal of UCD is to create products and services that meet the specific needs of the users, resulting in improved user satisfaction, productivity, and overall experience. UCD recognises that users are the experts in their own needs and preferences, and by involving them in the design process, it ensures that their perspectives are considered and incorporated into the final solution.

# Design the Project

The goal of this phase of the project is to analyse the requirements of the project and design a solution. This should be done in groups, even if the project is individual - so ideas can be bounced around (brainstorming).

To Analyse the requirements:

1. Read the Project Details page for this project
2. Read the assessment documents.
3. Research and experiment with similar projects
    1. Note distinctive features.

Write down your notes or ideas.

## Design the Solution

Once the requirements analysis is complete, it’s time to design your solution. This can be done through a few stages.

### Define the target audience

Decide who will be using your product. Using the supplied Persona template, create two examples of users who you will be designing the product for. These users could be “casual gamers”, “dentists”, “Sci-fi fans”, etc.

You can find more information regarding personas here.

### Define the Scope

What is Scope:

Project scope refers to the specific goals, deliverables, tasks, and resources that are defined and agreed upon at the beginning of a project. It outlines the boundaries and limitations of the project, including what will be included and excluded from the project. The project scope provides direction and clarity to the project team and stakeholders, helping to ensure that everyone is aligned on the project objectives and expectations. It also helps to prevent scope creep, which is when the project expands beyond its original boundaries, causing delays, cost overruns, and a decrease in quality.
