## Update your fork

Periodically, there may be updates to the main repository. In your fork, sync the changes which will merge the updates with your repository. 

You will then need to pull the changes down to your computer through Github Desktop (or your preferred method).

## Merge your changes with the main Holocron

You may be asked to create a pull request to merge your changes into the main repository.

To do so, go to your repository on GitHub.com.  

If your repository has changes that the main repository does not have, you'll see a banner similar to this:

![repoBranchAhead](/_sharedContent/_images/repoBranchAhead.png)

Click the Contribute button, then Open Pull Request.

![repoContribute](/_sharedContent/_images/repoContribute.png)


On the next screen enter a **meaningful** title and description, then click `Create Pull Request`.

If your changes are deemed appropriate, then the changes will be merged in.
