> [!Note]- This significantly speeds up development time.

One of the main annoyances with developing in Flask is that you have to stop and restart the server when developing to test new code.

Running the server in **debug** mode can make this process faster as you don't need to restart the server!

## Debug the site

Click on the `Run and Debug` tab, and click on the run button indicated

The remainder of your development process will be the same, except you **do not** need to regularly restart the server to test new code!
