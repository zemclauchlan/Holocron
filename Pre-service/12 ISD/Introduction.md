# Communication with Clients

Developing this skill will help you define scope and work efficiently towards the goals of whatever project you are working on.
<br>
Achieving this VET Competency will allow you to show to potential employers that you can ease the communication between yourself and Clients. This is even more important when communicating with a client that has LIMITED TECHNICAL KNOWLEDGE.
<br>
I will be assessing you on your ability to describe and explain your design process and design choices to a person who has never touched programming.
