> [!info]- Project Overview
> Welcome to this tutorial on building a First-Person Shooter (FPS) game using Godot
>   This tutorial is designed to guide you through the process of creating an FPS game from scratch, providing step-by-step instructions and explanations along the way.  
>   
>   Godot is a powerful, open-source game engine that is highly flexible and customisable, making it an excellent choice for game development.   
>   It supports a variety of platforms and offers a unique and intuitive scene system.    
>   
>   In this tutorial, we will cover key aspects of game development such as setting up the player character, implementing movement and shooting mechanics, creating enemies, and designing levels.   
>   
>   We will also delve into more advanced topics such as raycasting and scripting.    
>   By the end of this tutorial, you will have a fully functional FPS game that you can further customise and expand upon.  
>   
>   These instructions are written for Godot v4.2.2
