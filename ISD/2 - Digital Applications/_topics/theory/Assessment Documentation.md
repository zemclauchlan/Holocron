# Technical Analysis

In this section, research and explain how the Enemy 'AI' is implemented in the game. 
You will need to start at the foundations - look into [Vectors](ISD/2%20-%20Digital%20Applications/_topics/theory/Vectors.md), [Pathfinding](ISD/2%20-%20Digital%20Applications/_topics/theory/Pathfinding.md) and how it is implemented in the game.
