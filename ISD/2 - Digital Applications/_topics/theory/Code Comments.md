To Demonstrate understanding of code, you can use code comments (or internal documentation).

# Function Descriptions

Use the following template to include at the top of each function to describe the purpose and use of the function:

```gdscript
/*
Description:
Inputs:
Outputs:
*/
```

## Example

![commentsFunction](ISD/2%20-%20Digital%20Applications/_topics/theory/images/commentsFunction.png)

# Inline Comments

The other type of code comments is "inline" comments. These are used to explain one line of code, or a block of code to describe its logic or purpose. 

## Example

![commentsInline](ISD/2%20-%20Digital%20Applications/_topics/theory/images/commentsInline.png)
