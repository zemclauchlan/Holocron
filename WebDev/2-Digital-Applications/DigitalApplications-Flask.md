> [!note]- Project Overview
> This semester you will develop A New Homepage (ANH), which will be based in the Flask environment. 
> This project can be developed either online through GitHub Codespaces, or locally on your device (not a chromebook) with Visual Studio Code & Docker.
> The class will be delivered in an online / remote mode, meaning that you are responsible for keeping up with the work posted on this page. 

This unit focuses on continuing Flask Website development, in an **online/remote learning environment**. There are no scheduled lessons in the timetable, and it is assumed that students complete the work during the week and submit the necessary items by the end of the week.

> [!warning]- Attendance & Submission of Work
> The work submitted is a requirement to be deemed to be in attendance for that week. If you do not submit the work, you will not be marked present for the lessons in that week (unless you have contacted the school or teacher with a valid reason).

Submissions are due **11:59pm Friday** each week.

> [!info]- Technical Overview
> Exploring Web Development: Building a Personal Website with Flask, HTML, and CSS
> Our goal? To build a personal website using Flask, HTML, and CSS.    
> ## The Tech Stack
> ### 1. Flask
> - **What Is It?** Flask is a Python web framework. It’s lightweight, flexible, and perfect for small to medium-sized projects.
> - **Why Use It?** Flask simplifies routing, handling requests, and managing templates. Plus, it integrates seamlessly with Python.
> ### 2. HTML (Hypertext Markup Language)
> - **What Is It?** HTML is the language of the web. It structures content, defines headings, paragraphs, links, and more
> - **Why Use It?** Without HTML, there would be no web pages. It’s the foundation of everything we see online.
> ### 3. CSS (Cascading Style Sheets)
> - **What Is It?** CSS adds style and visual appeal to our HTML. It controls fonts, colors, layouts, and animations.
> - **Why Use It?** CSS turns plain text into beautiful, well-designed web pages. It’s the artist’s palette for our website.
>## Features We’ll Build
> 1. Resume Builder
> 	1. Users can input their resume details (education, work experience, skills).
> 	2. Flask handles form submissions, and the data is stored securely.
> 	3. The resume dynamically appears on the website.
> 2. Shopping Cart
> 	1. Whether you’re selling products or just simulating e-commerce, the shopping cart feature is essential.
> 	2. Users can add items, view their cart, and calculate totals.
> 3. To-Do List
> 	1. Stay organized with an interactive to-do list.
> 	2. Add tasks, mark them as completed, and edit as needed.
> 	3. Data persists even if the browser is closed.
> 4. Navigation
> 	1. A sleek menu guides users to different sections of the website.
> 	2. From the homepage to the resume builder, everything is accessible.
>
> Remember, mistakes are part of the process. Embrace them, learn from them, and enjoy the journey. Happy coding!
