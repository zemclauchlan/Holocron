# Welcome to Week 4

Focus: Resume Builder

# Resume Builder

Three components:
1. Creating Resume Entries
2. Editing Resume Entries
3. Displaying complete Resume

# Database

All the experience data will be stored in one table.

`userID` is the current user's id from the `user` table.

note: Both work and education experience will be stored in one table, as they are both very similar data required.
The boolean `experienceWork` identifies it as work (true) or education (false).

# Code Updates

Model-View-Controller

A more complex version of the TODO app.

Creating:
- Templates (View),
- Database & `model.py` (Model)
- `app.py` & `forms.py` (Controller)
