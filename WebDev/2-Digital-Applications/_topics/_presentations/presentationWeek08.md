### Pins
I'll use pins throughout the practical modules to show where some extension work might be available for anyone wanting to test themselves. These will always be relevant to future work so if you are able to complete them or at least try them I highly recommend doing so as it will give you a big advantage in doing future work.<br>
The pin will denote where in the sequence of work you might attempt the extension or where it is applicable. I'll always explain the extension in the video rather than clogging up the task with extra words.
