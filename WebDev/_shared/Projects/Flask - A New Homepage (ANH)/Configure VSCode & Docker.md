> This step is optional.

If you are programming on a desktop computer or laptop (not chromebook), it is possible to configure your device to develop this project on.

First you need to install **Visual Studio Code** and **Docker**.

Once that's been done, you can clone the project to your computer. 


Open the project in Visual Studio code by choosing Open Folder from the file menu. Choose the folder that you clones the project into.

![[WebDev/_shared/Projects/Flask - A New Homepage (ANH)/images/vsCodeOpen.png]]

When the project opens, you'll be asked whether you want to reopen the project in the container.

![[WebDev/_shared/Projects/Flask - A New Homepage (ANH)/images/vsCodeOpenInContainer.png]]

Choose that option and the project will reopen, as well as Docker in the background. 

You can continue to configure and develop the project as normal.

## Why?

This configures your device in the same manner as Codespaces, except you're developing on your computer, meaning it's a bit faster, and less reliant on a stable internet connection.
